# Embedded_IoT_Basics
A repository of basic implementations and experiments in embedded systems and IoT.

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of hands-on experiments using Arduino, ESP8266, and various hardware components like LEDs, switches, OLEDs, and temperature sensors. It is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of embedded systems.

Currently, the repository focuses on basic hardware experiments. IoT functionalities have not been implemented yet but will be added as I explore and learn more about them in the future. The repository will also be updated with new experiments and additional sensors as I progress.
